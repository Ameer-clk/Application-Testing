# ClickJack Testing and XSS Testing Tool

## Overview

The ClickJacking Testing Tool is a utility designed to detect and assess ClickJacking vulnerabilities, also known as X-Frame-Options attacks. ClickJacking is a client-side attack where an attacker maliciously embeds a hidden iframe or element on a webpage, tricking users into interacting with it unintentionally. This tool aids in identifying such vulnerabilities in web applications, helping  security professionals and developers secure their systems against this type of attack.

XSSChecker is a security tool designed to identify potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. XSS is a common attack vector that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
